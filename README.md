Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering priciples,methods and tools to design,develop,test, deploy and maintain high quality software systems.It plays a major role in the technnology industry by enabling creation of sofware systems that power different aspects of our lives like finance.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software Engineering was estabished as a disciplie in the 1960s. In the 1970s was the advent of structured programming and in 2000s saw the rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- gather and document user needs and system requirements
Design- create detailed desing of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation- write code and build software according to the desing
Testing- to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment- release software to constomers
Maintenance- Provide ongoing support and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall metodology is a sequential approach to software development with a linear progression through distinct phases.This methodology would be appropriate on project that must adhere to strict compliance standards and whose objectives are clear.eg building a system for finance.
Agile methodology on the other hand is an iterative and incremental approach to software development which focuses more on flexibility,collaboration and response to change.It is best used when requirements are expected to revolve and change overtime eg developing a web page where updates are done regularly to keep users engaged

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is resonsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
A quality Assuarance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IEDs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code they include Visual Studio and Eclipse
VCS are softwares for tracting changing changes in the source code and cordinating work against team members eg Git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements a strategy to overcome this challenge is to ensure effective communication.
Tight deadlines as strategy ro overcome this challenge is to prioritize tasks
Technical debt a strategy to overcome this is to implement agile methodologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components of a software, it ensures each component behaves well in isolation
Integration testing is testing iteractions between different componenets to ensure different components work together nicely
System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.It helps identify errors that may have been missed during unit and integration testing improving overall software quality.
Acceptance testing is testing software against uset requirements to ensure it meets user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best response from AI models. It helps improve interaction between humans and AI models like chatbots and virstual assistants.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague propt is for example "Tell me about money"
An improved one is "Provide an overview of the development of currencies from ancient times to present day highiighting key developments."
This new prompt is more effective because it is clear, concise and complete
